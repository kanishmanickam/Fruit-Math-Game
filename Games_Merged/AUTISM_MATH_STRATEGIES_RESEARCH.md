## 1. COUNTING

### Research-Based Strategies

#### 1.1 One-to-One Correspondence with Touch Interaction
**Strategy:** Children physically touch or move each object while counting aloud.

**Evidence Base:**
- **Source:** National Professional Development Center on Autism Spectrum Disorder (NPDC)
- **Finding:** Task analysis combined with tactile engagement improves number sense in children with ASD
- **Rationale:** Multisensory input (visual, tactile, auditory) strengthens neural pathways and reduces abstract processing demands

**Implementation:**
- Interactive touch-to-count interfaces
- Objects highlight or animate when touched
- Audio feedback for each count
- Sequential illumination to guide counting order

#### 1.2 Subitizing Practice
**Strategy:** Instant visual recognition of small quantities (1-5) without counting.

**Evidence Base:**
- **Source:** Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders
- **Finding:** Structured subitizing practice improves number fluency and reduces counting-related anxiety
- **Rationale:** Reduces cognitive load by building automatic number recognition

**Implementation:**
- Flash cards with small quantities
- Timed recognition games (without pressure)
- Dice patterns and dot arrangements
- Consistent visual arrangements (e.g., dice patterns)

#### 1.3 Visual Number Lines
**Strategy:** Use horizontal or vertical number lines as visual anchors for counting.

**Evidence Base:**
- **Source:** TEACCH (Treatment and Education of Autistic and Communication-related handicapped CHildren)
- **Finding:** Visual structure reduces anxiety and provides concrete reference points
- **Rationale:** Externalizes the counting sequence, making abstract concepts concrete

**Implementation:**
- Number line displayed alongside counting tasks
- Animated pointer moving along number line
- Color-coded sections for easier tracking
- Physical number lines for hands-on learning

#### 1.4 Consistent Object Grouping
**Strategy:** Present objects in organized, predictable arrangements.

**Evidence Base:**
- **Source:** Autism Classroom Resources (Dr. Chris Reeve)
- **Finding:** Visual organization reduces processing demands and improves accuracy
- **Rationale:** Children with ASD benefit from structured, predictable visual layouts

**Implementation:**
- Objects arranged in rows or circles
- Consistent spacing between objects
- Grid layouts for larger quantities
- Clear boundaries around counting areas

## 2. ADDITION

### Research-Based Strategies

#### 2.1 Concrete-Representational-Abstract (CRA) Sequence
**Strategy:** Progress from physical objects → pictures/drawings → abstract numbers.

**Evidence Base:**
- **Source:** Council for Exceptional Children (CEC)
- **Finding:** CRA instruction significantly improves mathematical understanding in students with learning disabilities including ASD
- **Rationale:** Gradual abstraction allows students to build conceptual understanding before working with symbols

**Implementation:**
- Start with physical manipulatives (blocks, counters)
- Move to pictorial representations (emojis, drawings)
- Finally introduce numerical symbols (3 + 2 = 5)
- Allow movement between levels as needed

#### 2.2 Part-Whole Visual Diagrams
**Strategy:** Use visual diagrams showing parts combining to make a whole.

**Evidence Base:**
- **Source:** Singapore Math Method (adapted for special education)
- **Finding:** Part-whole models improve conceptual understanding of addition relationships
- **Rationale:** Visual representation makes abstract relationships concrete

**Implementation:**
- Two separate boxes for addends
- Arrow pointing to combined result box
- Color-coding to distinguish parts from whole
- Physical containers for concrete learning

#### 2.3 Number Bonds
**Strategy:** Visual representation showing number relationships (e.g., 5 = 3 + 2 = 4 + 1).

**Evidence Base:**
- **Source:** Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders Journal
- **Finding:** Explicit visual representation of number relationships improves computational fluency
- **Rationale:** Shows multiple ways to make the same number, building flexibility

**Implementation:**
- Circle-and-line diagrams

- Connection to real-world groupings

#### 2.4 Visual Grouping with Clear Boundaries
**Strategy:** Physically separate addends with clear visual boundaries.

**Evidence Base:**
- **Source:** Structured Teaching Principles (TEACCH)
- **Finding:** Clear visual organization reduces confusion and improves task completion
- **Rationale:** Eliminates ambiguity about which objects belong to which group

**Implementation:**
- Separate containers or boxes for each addend
- Different colors for each group
- Labels: "Group 1", "Group 2", "Total"
- Physical dividers between groups

- **Rationale:** Builds foundational understanding before adding complexity

**Implementation:**
- Begin with AB patterns (red-blue-red-blue)
- Progress to ABB patterns (red-blue-blue-red-blue-blue)
- Then ABC patterns (red-blue-green-red-blue-green)
- Finally complex patterns (AABB, ABCD, etc.)

#### 5.2 Single Attribute Variation
**Strategy:** Change only ONE attribute at a time (color OR shape, not both).

**Evidence Base:**
- **Source:** Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders
- **Finding:** Multiple simultaneous changes increase cognitive load and confusion
- **Rationale:** Focused attention on single dimension improves pattern detection

**Implementation:**
